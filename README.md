# Chicago_Business_Licenses_Food_Inspections
This project, developed as part of the University of Chicago Data Engineering program, investigates the relationship between food inspection outcomes and business license statuses in Chicago. It uses Python, SQL, and relational database design to analyze whether inspection failures lead to regulatory actions like license suspensions or revocations.
